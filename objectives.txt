0. Create DADA2 submodule, clone aerosol main module (Done)

1. Parse ASVs by sample ()
	A. read them in similarly to parallel arrays GTEX
	B. Keep track of ASV counts similar to how we did in parallel arrays GTEX


2. Create a module that removes contaminants from flight samples ()
	A. If the abundance of a negative control ASV is greater than a flight sample ASV, remove it from the flight sample. 


3. Diversity metrics of ASVs based on sampling altitude, location, flight or ground ()
	A. create modules for alpha/beta diversity, NMDS, PCOA

4. Create matplotlib module for plotting diversity metrics ()

5. Create a script that integrates all modules ():
	A. Takes in an ASV table, tax_table, and metadata
	B. Removes contaminants
	C. Computes diversity metrics
	D. Generates plots
